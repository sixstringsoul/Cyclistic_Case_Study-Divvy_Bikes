Background and Business Task

A bicycle sharing company by the name of Cyclistic would like to further expand its business.  
The company operates much like Lime where users can rent bicycles for rides at self-serve stations across Chicago.
Once a bike is rented from a station it is also returned to a station at the end of the trip.
Users have the option to choose either a traditional pedal powered bike or an electric bike.
There are two rider types: casual riders who use one trip or daylong passes and member riders who purchased an annual membership.  
Cyclistic’s financial analysis team has concluded that annual members yield a higher profit margin than casual riders.  
Lilia Moreno, Cyclistic’s Marketing Director, agrees with this conclusion.  
It has become her goal to design a new marketing strategy that will maximize annual membership. 

There are three questions that will guide the formation of this new marketing strategy: 
1)	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2)	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3)	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

In this scenario, I have been assigned the duty of analyzing the usage difference between the two rider types.  
I have been provided access to the company’s bike logs from 2015 to the present day.  
To keep the analysis relevant to the current day, I will limit my analysis to the past 12 months.  
The end goal of my analysis is to create a presentation inclusive of my findings and top 3 recommendations.

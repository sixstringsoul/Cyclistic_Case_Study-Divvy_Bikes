##ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE##

#Now that the data has been cleaned and transformed, the next step is to perform the analysis.  
I chose to use the start times when looking at the rides by units of time as this was when the rider made the initial decision to use the service.  
The end goal here is to find the difference in the riding trends of member and casual riders.  
I will then condense the findings into a summary file to produce visualizations with Tableau.  

#Finding the total number of rides for both member and casual riders.
	total <- table(all$member_casual)
  
#Members have more total rides.

#Export summary
	write.csv(total, ‘total.csv’)

#Finding total minutes by rider type
	total_min <- aggregate(all$ride_length, list(all$member_casual), FUN=sum)
  
#Casual riders rode more minutes than members.

#Export summary
	write.csv(total_min, ‘total_min.csv’)

#Checking for any bike type preferences between the two rider types.
#Summarizing by bike type
	table(all$member_casual, all$rideable_type)
  
#Both rider types show a nearly identical preference for traditional bikes.  
Since this summary didn’t produce any meaningful insights for the business task, I omitted these results from my presentation.

#Finding start time totals for both rider types.  
#Creating time column.
	time <- separate(X202104, start_time, into('date', 'time'), sep=‘ ’)
#Summarize by rider type
	time <- table(time$member_casual, time$time)
 
#Both riders showed a preference to start rides at 1700.
  
#Export summary
	write.csv(time, ‘time.csv’)

#Finding the total rides by day of the week by rider type
	daytotal <- table(all$member casual, all$startday)

#These results are too varied to describe here.  
I figured they would be best explained by a stacked bar chart visualization.  
I used a different file than the summary created here to make the visualization. 
I will describe that process later in this document.  
For now I will export the summary for record keeping purposes.

#Export summary
	write.csv(daytotal, ‘daytotal.csv’)

#Finding the average day of week average by rider type
	dayavg <- aggregate(all$member_casual ~ all$ride_length + all$start_day, FUN = mean)
  
#The results are too varied to describe here.  
A stacked bar chart would best explain them.  
For these results I created a summary file which as also used for the data visualization.

#Export summary
	write.csv(dayavg, ‘dayavg.csv’)

#I wanted to find out if the variances in the totals and average ride lengths by month had a correlation to the temperature as this explanation would make the most sense.  
To compare the patterns I created a line chart to show how the temperature changed by month throughout the year.
#To create this chart I pulled the high low and average temperature data of the Chicago area by month from weather.gov.  
I manually entered this data into an Excel spreadsheet then uploaded it into Tableau.

#Finding the total rides by month by rider type
	totalmonth <- table(all$member_casual, all$start_month)
  
#The results are too varied to describe here.  
As with the total rides by day another file was create the visualization.  
I exported the summary here for record keeping purposes.

#Export summary
	write.csv(totalmonth, ‘totalmonth.csv’)

#Finding the average ride length by month by rider type.
	monthavg <- aggregate(all$member_casual ~ all$ride_length + all$start_month, FUN = mean)
  
#The results are too varied to describe here.  
For this stacked bar chart visualization, I used this summary file.

#Export summary
	write.csv(monthavg, ‘monthavg.csv’)

#Finding the top 10 start and end stations for casual riders.
#Filter for casual riders
	casual <- filter(all, member_casual = ‘casual’)
#Top start station
	casual_start <- table(casual$start_station_name)
#Top end station
	casual_end <- table(casual$end_station_name)
#Export summaries
	write.csv(casual_start, ‘casual_start.csv’)
	write.csv(casual_end, ‘casual_end.csv’)
  
#I then sorted and deleted all the entries below the top 10 in Excel.  
To produce the visualizations I created a chart with Powerpoint.

#Finding the top 10 start and end stations for member riders.
#Filter for member riders
	member <- filter(all, member_casual = ‘member’)
#Top start station
	member_start <- table(member$start_station_name)
#Top end station
	member_end <- table(member$end_station_name)
#Export summaries
	write.csv(casual_start, ‘member_start.csv’)
	write.csv(casual_end, ‘member_end.csv’)
  
#I then sorted and deleted all the entries below the top 10 in Excel.  
To produce the visualizations I created a chart with Powerpoint.

#Creating the total by day and month stacked bar chart file.
#The summary files I created for the totals by day and month were not being read correctly by Tableau.  
To work around this issue I created a smaller ‘all’ file to save processing power on Tableau’s public server.  
I used Tableau’s filters and table calculations to produce the visualizations.

#Assigning the variable to keep original file in tact.
	stack <- all
#Deleting the unneeded station info and bike type columns
	stack$start_station_name <- NULL
	stack$end_station_name <- NULL
	stack$start_lat <- NULL
	stack$end_lat <- NULL
	stack$rideable_type <- NULL
	stack$start_station_id <- NULL
	stack$end_station_id <- NULL
	stack$start_lng <- NULL
	stack$end_lng <- NULL
#Exporting the file
	write.csv(stack, ‘stack.csv’)
